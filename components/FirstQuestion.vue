        After getting a clear understanding of the scope, business needs and
        assets included in this campaign, I would suggest developing a web page
        as the main feature. Elements on this page would range from description
        to media sections and could also include internal and contact links. For
        the content integration, developers will create templates on the
        internal CMS platform to mirror the elements that are displayed on the
        webpage.

        If the showcased information needs to be tailored to a specific target
        audience (for example: special content for the internal viewer), I would
        consider developing two separate pages or implement sections that could
        only be viewed by a logged-in user.
