        For a short-term project with a short deadline, I do not think it would
        be the time to introduce new changes to the tech stack, so I would push
        for Nuxt with Vue (I also presume we would be adding a page to the
        current main website repository) and Contentful as the CMS, allowing
        content creators and editors to use a platform they are familiar with
        and get the project out as soon as possible.
