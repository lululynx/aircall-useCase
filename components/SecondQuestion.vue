        From reading the prompt, it is my understanding that this project is a
        short-term deliverable, with the aim of publishing a MLP in a few day's
        to a week's time.

        The first stage (or first day or 2, max) would consist of meeting with
        the person in charge of the project, who has the "ownership" of the
        business logic and domain. These meetings should be used to define the
        UI elements, stakeholders and clarify any question about the project and
        expected outcome. This meeting should also include designers to get the
        intial design as soon as possible. The infrastructure team should also
        join to be in the loop and start working on their end of the project.

        In the next stage, the development project will be initialized, laying
        out the groundwork, in other words creating a repository, establishing
        the scaffolding and divinding the work amongst developers. I would
        suggest using an Asana taskboard to manage this workflow and prioritize
        tasks and maintain clear communication lines between the tech team. Part
        of this development process will involve coding, creating templates on
        the CMS and working on smaller commits and pushes, which lends itself to
        faster peer review and iteration.
      </p>
      <p class="text-left py-4 mx-60">
        In the third stage, bug fixes and design finalizations should be
        addressed. The progress of the webpage should have been visible to any
        stakeholder throughout to make sure that the project is well on its way
        and that deployment should happen smoothly.
