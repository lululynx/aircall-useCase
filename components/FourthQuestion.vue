        The success of this project could be translated into a number of
        outcomes, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="py-10">
        <li class="text-left px-10">
          - The number of times the campaign page has been viewed and visited
        </li>
        <li class="text-left px-10">
          - The number of times links have been clicked
        </li>
        <li class="text-left px-10">
          - The click number on various UI elements
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-left py-50">
        To that end, analytics and breadcrumbs should be a part of the
        development cycle to be able to quantify the visitors and their
        interaction with the webpage.
